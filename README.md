## The Scene
My scene is depicting the inside of a small cafe like building.  I used a variety of objects from the asset packs Brick Project Studio's Apartment Kit and Puzzled Wizard's Coffee Shop Starter Pack, alongside some primitive GameObjects built into Unity.  I also used Avionx's Skybox Series Free as a free skybox asset and Yughues Free Wooden Floor Materials.  I was inspired to do this scene due to recently renovating my player housing in a game to look like a cafe, and tried to recreate it along with the inspiration sketches I had found.  The main character in my scene is just a green capsule that I scaled down a little bit to simply represent a person for scale within the cafe itself.
